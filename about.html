<section class="mission">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    At <strong>Beyond Grades</strong>, we believe college admissions should celebrate who students are — not just what they score. 
    In today’s test-optional era, authenticity, reflection, and purpose matter more than ever. 
    Our mission is to help students move beyond transcripts and test scores to uncover the story, passions, and purpose that make them shine.
  </p>
  <p>
    From building meaningful extracurriculars to crafting essays that speak from the heart, our counselors guide students with empathy, structure, and insight.
    We focus on more than college acceptance — we help young people develop clarity, confidence, and direction that will carry them through college and life beyond.
  </p>
